# data-cleaning-and-translation

## Overview
This is the T of ETL built in Python script for data migration process from old to new Salesforce CRM platform. 

### What is the data?
The company I work in deals with Patent Licensing business, so all data uses in these scripts are Patent related data. 

### How much is the data and Where is the data from?
Over 11,000 records were extracted from Salesforce platform and internal company database to 30 different excel spreadsheets. The new system will contain cleaner, more accurate, more complete data by combining data from various resources: old system, internal database, and external database (extract using API).


Important Note: Data and scripts uploaded to GitHub are Sample data, so it might not have the same amount of data as the actual migration process.

## Process
Performing data cleaning on various data: join, separate, and translate many-to-many data.
In old system, all values/information are stored within one page of record. In new system, the information will be stored in 4 different pages of record.
